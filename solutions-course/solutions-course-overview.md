Solutions in the Power Platform and Dynamics 365 drive consistency and efficiency in my configurations and have literally put hours back in my week. Every time I reuse one it's like paying myself a dividend on a little bit of extra up-front effort and planning.

## Using Solutions isn't hard, but it's a skill that needs to be learned

I want others to find the benefits of Solutions, too, but I haven't found a good resource to point people towards as a way to go from "I think I've heard of solutions, what are those again?" to "I get it--why haven't I done this since the beginning?"

## In this course, you will learn the core building blocks that will help you

- Increase your own productivity when configuring 
- Improve your ability to collaborate when building
- Share, reuse, and improve your work with more standardized configurations

It's a free course, open-source on GitHub, so go ahead and click on that first lesson and get started!
